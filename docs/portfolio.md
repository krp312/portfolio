## questions
how did mark do the anchor tag to fill out the entire box?

## general
breakpoints for jquery to test open-inner functionality -- think of it like css
waveform for my name
+/- animation on hover
use plugin: https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/accordion/?animated=1
collapse section link in the portfolios section
fill up and refine inner views
  photo for about, more desc
  portfolio section
  no numbers
  images
  fill out descriptions
    problems
    what's it for?
    technology, but not as important

## desktop
desktop, more spacing
hover effects
```
selector:hover {
  background-color: whatever;
}
```
desktop max width 800px
  margin: 0 auto;
  a lil space above intro, don't smush it at the top
opacity for 'aspiring behavior'
portfolio view on desktop will be horizontal (flexbox, good use case)
add more margin and space
