## questions
how did mark do the anchor tag to fill out the entire box?

## general
+/- minus behavior
rem conversion
  rem = absolute em
    has something to with parent
    if you set body font to 14, then everything will change relatively
    use it fonts
    use it for everything!
      tyler hardly uses ems, %s
    desktop 800px to 50rems
    pixels are inconsistent
photo for about, more desc
portfolio section
  no numbers
  images
  fill out descriptions
    problems
    what's it for?
    technology, but not as important
console error
open inner for each subsection
collapse section link in the portfolios section
opacity

## desktop
desktop, more spacing
hover effects
desktop max width 800px
  margin: 0 auto;
  a lil space above intro, don't smush it at the top
opacity for 'aspiring behavior'
portfolio view on desktop will be horizontal (flexbox, good use case)
add more margin and space

## mobile
fill up and refine inner views
