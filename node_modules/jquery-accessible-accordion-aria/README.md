# jQuery Accessible Accordion System, using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">ARIA</abbr>

## Demo

A demo page is here: https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/accordion/

It can be included for one, two accordion systems or more in a page.

<p>This jQuery plugin will transform a simple list of  <code>hx</code> and <code>div</code>’s into a <strong>fantastic-shiny accordion system</strong>, using <abbr title="Accessible Rich Internet Application">ARIA</abbr>.</p>


```
<div class="js-accordion" data-accordion-prefix-classes="your-prefix-class">
 <div class="js-accordion__panel">
   <h2 class="js-accordion__header">First tab</h2>
   here the content of 1st tab<br><br>
   <a href="#">pweet</a><br><br>
   plop
 </div>

 <div class="js-accordion__panel" data-accordion-opened="true">
   <h2 class="js-accordion__header">Second tab</h2>
   here the content of 2nd tab<br><br>
   <a href="#">pweet</a><br><br>
   plop
 </div>

 <div class="js-accordion__panel">
   <h2 class="js-accordion__header">Third tab</h2>
   here the content of 3rd tab<br><br>
   plop
 </div>

 <div class="js-accordion__panel">
   <h2 class="js-accordion__header">Fourth tab</h2>
   here the content of 4th tab<br><br>
   <a href="#">pweet</a><br><br>
   plop
 </div>
</div>
```

## How it works

Basically:

- each ```js-accordion__header``` is duplicated to ```your-prefix-class__title``` into accordion contents, before being replaced by a button ```your-prefix-class__header```
- each ```js-accordion__panel``` gets a class ```your-prefix-class__panel```
- Once the HTML markup is set up, all ARIA attributes are added to make the link between accordion buttons and accordion contents, to know which one is related to which other.
- Keyboard shortcuts of ARIA Design Pattern for accordions are added, and you can easily navigate and use it.

## Keyboard

Keyboard navigation is supported, based on ARIA DP (http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion):

__If you focus in the accordion "buttons"__
- use Up/Left to put focus on previous accordion button,
- use Down/Right to put focus on next accordion button
- use Home to put focus on first accordion button (wherever you are in accordion buttons)
- use End to put focus on last accordion button (wherever you are in accordion buttons)


__If you focus in a accordion content__
- use Ctrl Up/left to Set focus on the carrousel button for the currently displayed carrousel tab
- use Ctrl PageUp to Set focus on the previous carrousel button for the currently displayed carrousel tab
- use Ctrl PageDown to Set focus on the next carrousel button for the currently displayed carrousel tab

And strike space or return on an accordion button to open/close it

__New: if you focus on next/prev buttons__
- use Ctrl Up to set focus on the accordion button for the currently displayed accordion content
- use Ctrl PageUp to set focus on the previous accordion button for the currently displayed accordion content
- use Ctrl PageDown to set focus on the next accordion button for the currently displayed accordion content


__Warning__: Ctrl+PageUp/PageDown combination could activate for some browsers a switch of browser tabs. Nothing to do for this, as far as I know (if you have a solution, let me know).

## All options of the plugin
   
```var defaultConfig = {
 headersSelector: '.js-accordion__header',
 panelsSelector: '.js-accordion__panel',
 buttonsSelector: 'button.js-accordion__header',
 buttonsGeneratedContent: 'text', // html
 button: $('<button></button>', {
  class: 'js-accordion__header',
  type: 'button'
 }),
 buttonSuffixId: '_tab',
 multiselectable: true,
 prefixClass: 'accordion',
 headerSuffixClass: '__title',
 buttonSuffixClass: '__header',
 panelSuffixClass: '__panel',
 direction: 'ltr', // rtl
 accordionPrefixId: 'accordion'
};
```

When calling the plugin, you may set up options as you want. For example:
  
```
$(function () {
   $('.js-accordion').accordion({ buttonsGeneratedContent: 'html' });
});
```

Will call the plugin and generate buttons keeping <abbr title="HyperText Markup Language">HTML</abbr> content in the <code>Hx</code>.

## Bonuses

__Content opened by default__

If you want to have an accordion content opened by default, just add the attribute ```data-accordion-opened="true"``` on a ```js-accordion__panel```, example:

```
<div class="js-accordion__panel" data-accordion-opened="true">
```

__Wanna see it animated?__

In the demo https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/accordion/?animated=1 , you can see it animated. I’ve changed the attribute ```data-accordion-prefix-classes="minimalist-accordion"``` to ```animated-accordion```, without changing (almost) anything else to the page. Magic? No. :)

The magic is the same used for my <a href="https://a11y.nicolas-hoffmann.net/hide-show/">jQuery simple and accessible hide-show system animated</a>.

In fact, it is possible using some CSS transitions. You have to keep in mind several things to keep it accessible:

- You can’t animate the ```display``` property, and ```height``` property might be complicated too to animate.
- So you can’t use ```display: none;``` to hide a content (even for assistive technologies).
- You have to set up ```visibility``` to ```visible``` or ```hidden``` to show/hide a content.
- Basically, you should animate ```max-height```, ```opacity``` (if needed), and use ```visibility``` to hide content to assistive technology.

So here is the CSS code (unprefixed):

```
.animated-accordion__panel {
 display: block;
 overflow: hidden;
 opacity: 1;
 transition: visibility 0s ease, max-height 1s ease, opacity 1s ease ;
 max-height: 100em;
 /* magic number for max-height = enough height */
 visibility: visible;
 transition-delay: 0s;
 margin: 0;
 padding: 0;
}
/* This is the hidden state */
[aria-hidden=true].animated-accordion__panel {
 display: block;
 max-height: 0;
 opacity: 0;
 visibility: hidden;
 transition-delay: 1s, 0s, 0s;
 margin: 0;
 padding: 0;
}
```

Here is the trick: from “hidden” to “visible” state, ```visibility ```is immediately set up to ```visible```, and ```max-height```/```opacity``` are “normally” animated.

From “visible” to “hidden” state, the ```visibility``` animation is delayed. So the content will be immediately hidden… at the end of the animation of max-height/opacity.



__Other options__

The ARIA Design Pattern for accordions (http://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices/#accordion) allows to have several accordion panels opened at the same time (which is shown by the attribute ```aria-multiselectable="true"```). However, you might need to avoid this for design purposes or client request. To do this, you may set this attribute on the accordion container: ```data-accordion-multiselectable="none"```. Example:

```
<div class="js-accordion" data-accordion-multiselectable="none" …>
```

This option will set up ```aria-multiselectable="false"``` and the plugin will allow only one panel to be opened at the same time.


__RTL Support__

If the accordion is used on a RTL website, the keys will adapt themselves to it. :)



Enjoy.
